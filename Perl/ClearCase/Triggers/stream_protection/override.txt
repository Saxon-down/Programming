# Should be of the format "<PVOB> <login> <LAP:0|1> <Admin:0|1>
# Where 
#	<PVOB> is the PVOB this override should be applied to (a single pvob, or * for all)
#	<login> is the user's domain login
#       0 = is not a member, and
#       1 = is a member
# e.g. "* bugs.bunny 1 0" pretends that Bugs Bunny is a LAP but not an admin, for all pvobs
